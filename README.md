# Mininet usage

## Proposal
Consider a tree topology with depth (depth=4) and branching (fanout=2).
1. Using the standard Mininet command line, create the topology considering the standard MAC address, bw bandwidth of 25Mbps and Mininet controller (no need to specify); 
2. Inspect information about interfaces, MAC addresses, IP and ports through command lines; 
3. Run ping tests between the different nodes. 
4. Specify that host 1 on port 5555 will be a TCP server and host 2 a client and run iperf tests, considering one report per second with a 10-second test. Run the tests for bw bandwidths of 25 Mbps
